.SH DESCRIPTION
This file controls the operation of the
.B SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit
\[char46] It allows the system administrator to configure parameters such as:
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
@\+ Location of the IEEE OUI database
@\+ Location of the service/port\-numbers database
.TE

The configuration file follows the following general format:
.sp

  Variable1=Value1  # Comments
  Variable2=Value2
  
.fi

The following configuration options are currently supported:
.TP
\fBOUI\-Database\fR 
This variable specifies the location of the IEEE OUI database. If left unspecified, the IEEE OUI databased is expected to be found at "/usr/share/oui.txt". This is a stripped down version of the IEEE OUI list available at <http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt>. The tool is able to process the raw file available from the IEEE site (hence the included oui.txt file can be overwritten with a freshly downloaded copy without any additional processing).

.TP
\fBPorts\-Database\fR 

This variable specifies the service/port-number database. If left unspecified, the IEEE OUI databased is expected to be found at "/usr/share/ipv6toolkit/service-names-port-numbers.csv".
